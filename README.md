# My Personal Portfolio
This portfolio is a showcase of the skills I have learned, and projects I have completed to present. It will also include an about me section with personal details about myself, my contact information, as well as my LinkedIn and GitHub links.

## Creation of Portfolio
I have created this portfolio completely from scratch with the knowledge I have obtained from the bootcamp, as well as from independent research and study. I plan to use this portfolio in the future when searching for jobs upon completion of the bootcamp.

I have learned much more in just the process of creating this portfolio. I feel in the future as I continue to learn, I will continue to work on it and improve its overall appearance and functionality.

## Mock-Up
