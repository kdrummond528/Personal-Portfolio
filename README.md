## Creation of Portfolio
I have created this portfolio completely from scratch with the knowledge I have obtained from the bootcamp, as well as from independent research and study. I plan to use this portfolio in the future when searching for jobs upon completion of the bootcamp.

I have learned much more during the process of creating this portfolio. I feel in the future as I continue to learn, I will continue to work on it and improve its overall appearance and functionality.

## Mock-Up
The following animation shows what the intended web application's appearance and functionality initially was:
